# UniversityRetrospect

This is a website I created with the help of a YouTube tutorial after learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
The guided walkthrough gave me a stronger understanding of HTML semantics and structure, CSS styles and variables, and some basic JS functions such as addEventListener, getElementById, and querySelector.
I also incorporated my own additions such as a contact page and an account login page.
  (account login is purely visual, functionality was beyond my JS reach for the moment)
